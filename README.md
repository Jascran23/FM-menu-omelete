## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

During this project I reinforced and learned some important concepts.

- such as importing Google Fonts.
"stylesheet">

- Change the color of only the decimal li.
```css
.menuinstructions ol > li::marker{
   color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
   font-weight: 700; 
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue developing and achieve bigger projects with more clarity.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - For a better understanding of the flex display
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) -  A great resource for finding and implementing web fonts.
